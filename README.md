# MemeMe

Project 2 of my Udacity iOS Nanodegree coursework.

This app is designed to showcase my use of Apple's UIKit libraries.

This is a basic app which allows me to use several UIKit components and
integrate them into a functional whole.

The main challenges I faced with this app were getting used to the Storyboard
in Xcode, and how to lay out UI elements so that they were correctly
positioned on various screen sizes.
